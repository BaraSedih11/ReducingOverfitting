This repository contains an example of reducing overfitting in perdiction in decision trees

## Overview

Overfitting it's when the model fails to generalize well to the new data. In this example we solved the overfitting by manipulating the 

## Contents

- `quiz.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of solving overfitting in decision trees using Python.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset used in the notebook for demonstration purposes.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Polynomial-Regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Polynomial-Regression
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `polynomial_regression.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how polynomial regression is implemented using Python.
